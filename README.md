# Simmerv

Simmerv is a [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) SoC emulator written in Rust
and compilable to WebAssembly.  It started as a fork of [Takahiro's
riscv-rust emulator](https://github.com/takahirox/riscv-rust), but by
now 98% of the code has been rewritten, making it far more complete
and faster.  Ultimately, we expect it to become substantially faster,
but this work is delayed until we are able to run standard benchmarks
and off-the-shelf Linux distributions.

## Online Demo

You can run Linux on the emulator in your browser: [online demo is
here](https://tommythorn.github.io/simmerv/wasm/web/index.html)

## Features

- Emulates RISC-V RV64GC_Zba_Zicond processor and peripheral devices
  (PLIC, CLINT, virtio block device and a UART)
- Targets native and WASM

## Instructions/Features support status

- [x] RV64IMAC
- [x] RV64FD (*PARTIALLY* flags/rounding modes very lacking)
- [x] RV64Zifencei
- [x] RV64Zicsr
- [ ] Svnapot
- [x] Zba (part of "B", RVA22)
- [ ] Zbb (part of "B", RVA22)
- [ ] Zbs (part of "B", RVA22)
- [x] Zicond
- [x] CSR (nearly complete)
- [x] Sv39, Sv48, Sv57
- [x] Privileged instructions
- [-] PMP (this is intensionally not implemented as it will negatively affect performance)

The emulator supports all instructions listed above but some (like
many FP instructions) are not 100% to the spec.

- Boots Buildroot and Debian Trixie
- Linux OpenSBI and legacy BBL boot support

### Current Issues Being Worked

- Newer Linux kernel have issues (which is a problem for newer binaries)
- U-boot loads but hangs before hand-off; might be an issue with ELF loading

### High Priority Work Post Issues

- >> *Amortized decoding and instruction fusion via a instruction
  translation cache* <<

- Snapshot and resume

- Disk support without an in-memory copy (can WASM support this?)

- Improve the disassembler to recognize pseudo ops like li, mv, ret,
  etc. (This requires a structural change).

## How to run Linux

```sh
$ cargo r -r -- linux/fw_payload.elf -f linux/rootfs.img
```

or
```sh
$ cargo r -r -- -c linux/opensbi/fw_jump.elf,0x80000000 linux/vmlinux,0x80200000 -f linux/rootfs.img
```

## How to run riscv-tests

```sh
$ ./run-riscv-tests.sh
```
